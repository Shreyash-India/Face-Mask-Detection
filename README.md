## Inference
&#10686; This is a Deep Neural Network Face Mask Detection Project trained in Keras with over 7500+ Data points which, includes Samples of Person "With" & "Without" MASK.
 
&#10686; It is a Bi-class Classification CNN Model which predicts whether the Person has "Weared" Mask or "Not Weared" Mask.

&#10686; It also has a "Real time Face Mask Detection" Functionality built with open-cv & Face recognization cascade Classifier.

&#10686; Model has an Accuracy of 89%
